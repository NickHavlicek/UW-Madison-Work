Most of this code was written in advance since this was a Mechanical Engineering elective and not a Computer Science class, so I can't claim that I know what all of this code does. This folder compiles all of the code that makes an interesting final project work. I describe what sort of contribution or changes I made on which files, but most of the battle was reading the code and understanding something that somebody else had written (and frankly didn't document very well) in order to make the changes to it.
