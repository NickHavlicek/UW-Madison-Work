    "Adapted from MATLAB code written by Brandon Wilson for the purpose of altitude prediction given a set of physical parameters. This has a similar print results, but is focused on providing optimized estimates for tank sizing.\n",

    "If you have MATLAB and are familiar with it, I would suggest reading his original code first, as I made some changes specific to Julia to make it do what I wanted it to do. \n",
    "If you dont have MATLAB installed and would still perfer to read the MATLAB code, the html folder inside the alt_prediction 3 folder is where you should go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original MATLAB code dependes on trial and error inputs to choose suboptimal, but realistic, tank dimensions. This rewrite looks to optimize these suboptimal dimensions, as well as performing sensitivity analysis on parameters relevant to rocket development."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook alters preexisting MATLAB code originally written to calculate a rough estimate of predicted altitude given certain rocket dimensions and parameters. The code was originally written by Brandom Wilson and is included in the folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem to be solved\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single stage rocket to reach the highest altitude it can, one thing a rocket can do is produce thrust for the longest duration possible. These is primarily achieved by maximizing the amount of propellant in the rocket. Two separate tanks of Oxygen and Kerosene (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP-1) must hold an optimal amount of fuel such that they both run out at the same time. For this to be accomplished, the flow of fuel through the engine must be calculated or measured precicely, and the tanks must be sized accordingly. A third tank of pressurant will feed through the top of both tanks to keep propellant mass flow constant and as high as possible."

    "Feasibility of the model was considered with the help of Lucy Fitzgerald and Finn Roberts, the propulsion team lead and the structures team lead respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The variables\n",
    "\n",
    "An existing small rocket skeleton already exists, however exactly how the tanks will fit has not been decided. The chamber size for the tanks can be measured. Other than that, there is some flexibility of the design that will be up to Structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are further constraints that may be accounted for which are not in the code. This is a future problem for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Things to consider in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "- Centrifugal force on propellant due to roll of the rocket in flight\n",
    "- Expansion of tanks due to temperature changes. \n",
    "- Excess Fuel optimality. Which one should run out first?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Rocket parameters are either obtained from the physically existing small-scale rocket or are roughly estimated. Since this rocket is currently being built, a lot of the data is subject to change. This code will work for the large-scale rocket as far as I am aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes on the models\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to note is that mixture ratio, chamber pressure, combustion performance, and chamber temperature are all theoretically choosen based on the chemistry of the fuel. Some of these will be determined as we test the engine as it is being built."

    "#### Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "This sensitivity analysis was performed as an example of future analysis that can be performed as seen fit. In the future, this code will likely be modified multiple times to analyze the sensitivity of specific parameters individually. This analysis serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of the language, not as something that needs to be examined carefully. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, we analyze how a change in the mass flow of the propellant changes the operating pressure of the tanks. This might be relevant because tanks must be choosen with appropriate maximum pressure ratings. Tanks with higher pressure ratings might be more expensive or able to contain less fuel. Both of these are prohibitive to the end goal of altitude maximization. The numbers that are computed make sense relative to the parameters chosen. Mass flow only accounts for a portion of the total pressure on the tanks, so a large change in mass flow should not have a very large change on the overall tank pressure. Since the mass flow of the fuel is smaller than the oxidizer, the change in pressure corresponding to the same change in flow has a larger overall effect on the tank pressure. These results make analytic sense, showing that the model is behaving correctly. Whether the results are useful or not is a different question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since mass flows are in the single digit kg/s range, the dual variable outputs are large perturbations in the mass flow, on the order of 1 kg/s differences, thus causing large pressure swings shown by dual m_dot_ox and dual m_dot_f. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding more constraints and variables will increase the complexity of the model, and would allow for additional sensitivity analysis."

These considerations may or may not be possible to add to this code, and the limitations may need to be estimated within a certain tolerance. This tolerance could be added to this code. This code will likely be another tool in the toolbox, and not something that will give an absolute final result to anything."
