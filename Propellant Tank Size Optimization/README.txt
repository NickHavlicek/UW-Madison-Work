This was a group project that I basically did by myself for my Introduction to Optimization final project. At the time, I was involved with a student organization named Wisconsin 
Space Race (WISR) which was in the process of designing and manufacturing two bi-propellant liquid rockets, an approx 10 ft one as a cheaper proof of concept for fundraising and 
an approx 30 ft one for participation in the Dollar per Foot Challenge by Friends of Amateur Rocketry, Inc. 

I joined the club knowing that I wouldn't be doing much of the actual design or fabrication, but I knew that something as complicated as rocket engineering would have a problem 
that I could tackle better than anyone else. I found this optimization problem involving some already written MATLAB code that relied on using trial and error to predict the 
height that a rocket would reach given the dimensions of the rocket and the engin parameters. 

At the time that I joined, the team lead in charge of designing the structure of the rocket was starting to look into purchacing propellant tanks, and I saw that they weren't 
exactly sure what size tanks to use, so I set into translating the MATLAB code into Julia so that it would be easier to get approximate tank dimensions. 

This is described in more detail in the final submission pdf.
